    <h2>The Queen Bee</h2>
    <div class="box">
    <p>Once upon a time, there were three princes who set out on a journey to explore the world. The two older brothers were strong and bold, but they were also very selfish. The youngest prince, however, was kind-hearted and gentle. Because of this, his older brothers often made fun of him and called him Simpleton.

        One day, while traveling through a dense forest, the three brothers came across an anthill. The two older brothers wanted to destroy the anthill and see the little ants running in panic. But Simpleton stopped them and said, "Leave the ants in peace. They have done nothing to harm us."
        
        The brothers continued their journey and soon came upon a lake. On the lake, there were many ducks swimming peacefully. The older brothers wanted to catch and roast some ducks, but Simpleton again stopped them. "Leave the ducks alone. They have done nothing to harm us."</p>
